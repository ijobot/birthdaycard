My wife's birthday was around my 2 month mark of my studies, so I wanted to make her something cute that showed off my new skills.

This was a bit of practice on linear gradient backgrounds, div positioning, and "fixed" position.  At the time of the project, this took me a few hours to get everything just right.  It's great to know that I could recreate this - and probably make it look even better - in a much shorter amount of time today.
